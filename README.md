# ARIMA-MODELS-
This is a repository for practicing and modelling ARIMA models which can be used for hybrid models and be used to detect linearity of models
The air passengers dataset has been used to get the forcasting vales
The window size is set to 12(as the forecasting has to be done for a year) and it can also taken as 6 and 4 respectively for half and quarter yearly prediction
The ARIMA models work on stationary data, so in order to check the same, we use the ADF test to check null hypothesis and devise if it is stationary or not
